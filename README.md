Student Management System is a simple Java console-based application designed to manage student records efficiently. The project demonstrates core Java concepts such as classes and objects, arrays, loops, switch cases, and Scanner for user input. It provides basic CRUD operations including adding, deleting, updating, and viewing student details. Each student record contains an ID, name, mobile number, email ID, and three subject marks. The application also allows users to display all students, search for a particular student by ID, and view the total number of students stored. The system runs through a menu-driven interface, making it easy to interact with. This project is intended for learning purposes and can be enhanced further by using ArrayList, adding file or database storage, input validation, or a GUI interface
